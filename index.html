            The <b>data analyst</b> is responsible for taking actionable that
            affects the current scope of the company. The
            <b>data engineer</b> is responsible for developing a platform that
            <b>data analysts</b> and <b>data scientists</b> work on. And, the
            <b>data scientist</b> is responsible for unearthing future insights
            from existing data and helping companies to make data-driven
            decisions.

            The <b>data analyst</b> does not directly participate in the
            decision-making process, rather, he helps indirectly through
            providing static insights about company performance. The
            <b>data engineer</b>
            is not responsible for decision making. And, The
            <b>data scientist</b> participates in the active decision-making
            process that affects the course of the company.

            The <b>data analyst</b> uses static modeling techniques that
            summarize the data through descriptive analysis. On the other hand,
            The <b>data engineer</b> is responsible for the development and
            maintenance of data pipelines. The <b>data scientist</b> uses
            dynamic techniques like Machine Learning to gain insights about the
            future.

            Knowledge of machine learning is not important for
            <b>data analysts</b>. However, this is mandatory for
            <b>data scientists</b>. The <b>data engineer</b> may not be required
            to have the knowledge of machine learning but he is required to have
            the knowledge of core computing concepts like programming and
            algorithms to build robust data systems.

            with unstructured data as well.
